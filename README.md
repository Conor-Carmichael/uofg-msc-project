A robotics simulation project for completion of the MSc Data Science program at the University of Glasgow.

Notes:
Until I have time to refactor some code, many file paths are dependent on my base file path. You will need to in many python files change "/home/conor/msc-project/"


Files to change:
- map_pipeline.py: line 61
- frames_to_mp4.py: line 8
- navigation_controller.py: line 120
- navigation_tracker.py: line 39
- navigate.launch: line 44
- aal_bot_processor.py: lines 17, 18, 19, 20, 45, 59
